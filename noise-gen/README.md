A learning project about Pseudo-random number generation, different types of noise generation, and Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) - including:

- A complete implementation of a 2-dimensional vector library.
- Several different Pseudo-random number generator.
- Different hashing functions.
- Different types of noise.
- Fractional Brownian Motion.
- Type-safe implementation rules, for ease and safety of future use.
