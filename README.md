A collection of learning exercises and short projects with no better place to go

This is really just a collection if independent smaller projects, learning exercises, and whatever else I do for fun.
There will be some good code, some less good code, some useful projects and examples and some things I write for fun only that will serve no easily conceiveable real-world application
