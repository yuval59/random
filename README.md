# Yuval's stuff

A collection of learning exercises and short projects with no better place to go

This is really just a collection of independent smaller projects, learning exercises, and whatever else I do for fun.
There will be some good code, some less good code, some useful projects and examples and some things I write for fun only that will serve no easily conceiveable real-world application

## Current projects:

- ### linked-list:

  > A small, simple implementation of a (very) basic linked list data structure.

- ### noise-gen:

  > A learning project about Pseudo-random number generation, different types of noise generation, and Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) - including:
  >
  > - A complete implementation of a 2-dimensional vector library.
  > - Several different Pseudo-random number generator.
  > - Different hashing functions.
  > - Different types of noise.
  > - Fractional Brownian Motion.
  > - Type-safe implementation rules, for ease and safety of future use.

- ### n-dimensions:

  > A simple implementation of an n-dimensional vector library.

- ### primes:
  > Some learning exercises in different methods of calculating primes and comparisons of methods
