# Yuval's stuff

A collection of learning exercises and short projects with no better place to go

This is really just a collection of independent smaller projects, learning exercises, and whatever else I do for fun.
There will be some good code, some less good code, some useful projects and examples and some things I write for fun only that will serve no easily conceiveable real-world application

## Current projects:

- ## [linked-list](src/linked-list/)

  A small, simple implementation of a (very) basic linked list data structure.

- ## [noise-gen](src/noise-gen/)

  A learning project about Pseudo-random number generation, different types of noise generation, and Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm).

  > [README](src/noise-gen/README.md)

- ## [n-dimensions](src/n-dimensions/)

  A simple implementation of an n-dimensional vector library.

- ## [primes](src/primes/)

  Some learning exercises in different methods of calculating primes and comparisons of methods.
