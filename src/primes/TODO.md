# TODO:

- [ ] Change return values from Tuples
- [ ] Changing the calculator types

  - [ ] Removing PrimeCalculator<IsChecked>
  - [ ] Implementing a check for the calculator function that was passed (possibly using [**this**](https://catchts.com/infer-arguments))

    > I can just implement this using two different comparisons, but where's the fun in that?
